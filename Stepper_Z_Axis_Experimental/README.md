# Alternate plotter head with stepper

This folder contains an alternate plotter head design for the terraPen plotter.  It uses a stepper for the z-axis and is designed CAN control using BigTreeTech EBB 42 Can Bus control board mounted on the plotter head.

There are 2 files for FreeCad v1.0.1, one containing the plotter head, the other containing a design for the pen holder insert.

The plotter head should be printed with ABS and the pen holder insert sould be printed using TPU, I use TPU 95A.  I use a 0.2mm nozzle for the ABS and 0.6mm nozzle for the TPU.

The pen holder insert CAD file is parametric, you can open the variable set and modify the top and bottom diameters to fit your pen.
